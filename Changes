      Marcus Holland-Moritz discovered that Devel::Arena was leaking memory,
      and sent a patch. It turns out *I* hadn't read
      http://search.cpan.org/~nwclark/perl/pod/perlxs.pod#Returning_SVs,_AVs_and_HVs_through_RETVAL
      (I just tried returning HV*, and found that the default typemaps seemed
      to handle it. Bad plan)
